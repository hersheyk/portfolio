# Overall thoughts:

I was very proud to get this lab up and working. I definitely learned a lot in the process. I believe a lot of what I learned in making static quarto dashboards was encapsulated in lab 4 with the interactive dashboards and lab 2, where I set up a lot of the initial data. As a result, I do not mention this lab too much in the final reflection. I believe the main standard this lab showcases is RW: 3 as I label all my code chunks and in value boxes, I use code-chunk options.

## RW-3

```{r}
#| eval: False
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Country with Lowest Belief in Vaccine Safety"
#| color: danger
list(
  value = toupper(lowest_country)
)
```

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Geetha/OneDrive/Documents/STAT541/portfolio/images/labeledchunks.JPG")
```

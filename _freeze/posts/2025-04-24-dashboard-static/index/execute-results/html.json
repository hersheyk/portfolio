I definitely learned a lot in the process. I believe a lot of what I learned in making static quarto dashboards was encapsulated in lab 4 with the interactive dashboards and lab 2, where I set up a lot of the initial data. As a result, I do not mention this lab too much in the final reflection. I believe the main standard this lab showcases is RW: 3 as I label all my code chunks and in value boxes, I use code-chunk options.\n\n## RW-3\n\n\n\n::: {.cell content='valuebox' title='Country with Lowest Belief in Vaccine Safety' color='danger'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist(\n  value = toupper(lowest_country)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"C:/Users/Geetha/OneDrive/Documents/STAT541/portfolio/images/labeledchunks.JPG\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../images/labeledchunks.JPG)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can visit my published static dashboard below:\n\n<https://hersheythegr8.quarto.pub/lab-3/#belief-in-vaccine-safety-statistics>\n",
